    <p>At the 12 km (7.5 mi) point on the Tirupati – Tirumala Ghat road, there is a major discontinuity of stratigraphic significance that represents a period of remarkable serenity in the geological history of the Earth. This is referred to as the Eparchaean Unconformity. This unconformity separates the Nagari Quartzite of the Proterozoic from the granite of the Archean, representing a time gap of 800 Mya.[6] In 2001, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) declared the Eparchaean Unconformity to be one of the 26 "Geological Monuments of India".</p>
    <p>Silathoranam, a natural arch and a distinctive geological wonder is located in Tirumala Hills at a distance of 1 km (0.62 mi) from Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. The arch measures 8 m (26 ft) in width and 3 m (9.8 ft) metres in height and is eroded out of quartizite of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic (1600 to 570 Mya) by weathering agents such as water and wind.[7]</p>
